# CRA-prep

![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/cra-prep)

Are you tired of the chores you need to do after you run create-react-app and before you start writing some sweet React components? This package automates the first few chores after running create-react-app, including making a components folder, setting up App folder, moving relevant files, and cleaning out extraneous demo code bits.

## Install

```
$ npm install cra-prep
```

**STILL IN DEVELOPMENT! Coming soon!**
